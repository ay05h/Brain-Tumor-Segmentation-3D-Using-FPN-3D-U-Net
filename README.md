# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-3D-Using-FPN-3D-U-Net
This repository contains the codebase for 3D brain tumor segmentation using a hybrid FPN-3D U-Net model. The project was developed to address challenges in automating tumor segmentation in MRI scans, focusing on precise delineation of tumor boundaries for enhanced diagnostic insights and treatment planning.
